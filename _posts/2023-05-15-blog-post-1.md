Hello, World! 

I thought these blog posts would be a good place to share my interests outside of mathematics. A big part of my life is running! I started running (very slowly) back in 2007. One of my goals is to qualify for New York City Marathon sometime during my PhD (2:53:00 full or 1:21:00 half for my age group).

If you are every in NYC and want to run, add me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/28918735).
