On June 7-10, 2023, I had the opportunity to participate in the SIAM Graduate Student Mathematical Modeling Camp [GSMCC 2023](https://www.mathsci.udel.edu/events/conferences/gsmmc) hosted at the University of Delaware. The GSMMC gathers graduate and advanced undergraduate students to work together in teams, guided by faculty mentors, and tackle real-world problems inspired by industrial applications. 

Our group worked on using particle filtering to clarify impure models and data. We used a Sequential Importance Sampler to infer the parameters and states of a epidemiological metapopulation model. We also looked at the particle flow filiter as an alternative to address some of the weaknesses of traditional particle filters such as filter divergence and the curse of dimensionality. These projects were designed prior to the workshop, and it just so happened that this one aligned with my current research! Overall, I had a great experience, and would highly recommend the program to any graduate student!
