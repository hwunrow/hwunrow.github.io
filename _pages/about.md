My name is Han Yong (first name) Wunrow (last name). Currently, I am a third year PhD Student in the [Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/), advised by [Jeffrey Shaman](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/jls106/), [Marc Spiegelman](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mspieg/), and [Sen Pei](http://www.columbia.edu/~sp3449/).


My doctoral research revolves around leveraging advanced mathematical modeling and computational science techniques to extract valuable insights from sequential time-series data from diverse domains including disease dynamics and finance. In particular, my research interests include data assimilation, Bayesian inference, and probabilisic machine learning. Outside of mathematics, I am interested in pedagogy, cross-country skiing, and running.


Before Columbia, I received my MS in applied mathematics from the [University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/) and my BS in mathematics from the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/math). Prior to graduate school, I was a Post-Bachelor Fellow at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/).
