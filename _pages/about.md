My name is Han Yong (first name) Wunrow (last name). Currently, I am a second year PhD Student in the [Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics, Columbia University](https://www.apam.columbia.edu/), advised by [Jeffrey Shaman](https://blogs.cuit.columbia.edu/jls106/), Marc Spiegelman](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~mspieg/), and [Sen Pei](http://www.columbia.edu/~sp3449/).

I am interested in the science of transforming raw health data into actionable information through mathematical modeling and computational science. In particular, my research interests include data assimilation, Bayesian inference, and probabilisic modeling. Outside of mathematics, I am interested in advocacy, workplace organizing, and running.


Before Columbia, I received my MS in applied mathematics from the [University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/) and my BS in mathematics from the [University of Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/math). Prior to graduate school, I was a Post-Bachelor Fellow at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/), where I worked on the [Global Burden of Disease study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30925-9/fulltext) and the [Future Health Scenarios](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext) forecasting team.
